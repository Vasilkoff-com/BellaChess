# BellaChess - A Decentralized Chess Game 

Welcome to the BellaChess project! This project is a chess game enhanced with unique crypto features. It provides an exciting glimpse into the potential of blockchain technology in the gaming industry. 

The BellaChess project is split across three separate repositories, each catering to a different aspect of the game.

## [Flutter Chess Game](https://github.com/MaxSmile/BellaChess)

This repository contains the core chess game developed in Flutter. It features a classic game of chess with an intuitive interface that can be played between two players. 

## [NextJS DApp](https://github.com/MaxSmile/BellaChessDApp)

This repository houses the decentralized application (DApp) part of the project. The DApp interacts with the game's smart contracts to enable in-game betting and other crypto features. The DApp is built using Next.js and Ether.js libraries.

## [Hardhat Smart Contracts](https://github.com/MaxSmile/BellaChessContracts)

This repository contains the game's smart contracts, developed using Hardhat. These contracts power the in-game betting feature, handle token balances, and manage other on-chain activities. 

## Setup and Installation 

To run the complete project, clone each of the three repositories and follow the setup instructions in the README files of each repository.
